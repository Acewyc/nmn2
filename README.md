# Neural module networks: SHAPES experiments


This branch contains data and horrible, slow Theano code for the SHAPES
experiments described in the paper:

> [Neural module networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02799). Jacob Andreas,
> Marcus Rohrbach, Trevor Darrell and Dan Klein. CVPR 2016. 

For details about the general NMN framework (and code for other tasks), look at
the `master` branch.

To run our experiments, call

    python main.py

You will need [Lasagne v0.1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Lasagne/0.1) and its
dependencies.

The optimizer seems to occasionally get stuck in local optima, so try restarting
if it doesn't converge to near-perfect accuracy the first time.

Code used to generate the dataset can be found in the `data` directory. The
dataset generated by this script is random, so please use the exact version of
the dataset provided in this repository when reporting results of any
experiments. See `visualize.py` for examples of how to convert array data into 
actual images.
